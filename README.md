# ToDoList App

This is a todolist app that incorporates my knowledge of nodeJS, ejs templating, mongoDB and web development as a whole. This app allows you to create custom to-do lists and add items to each of these lists. The items can then be deleted once they are completed. To create a new custom list, you simply add a '/' and append the custom list name that you would like to the end of the url.

The data for the todolist app is stored on MongoDB's atlas platform. The web application itself is hosted on heroku at the following web address: https://powerful-shelf-75925.herokuapp.com/
